Different levels of theory have been tested for the first step of the mechanism: the acetylene + OH radical reaction. Based on these results the meta-hybrid functional MPWB1K has been chosen for modeling all the other steps involved in the oxidation of acetylene. Different reaction paths have been considered and the one leading to glyoxal formation and OH regeneration is predicted to be the main channel, independently of the presence of NOx. Two different mechanisms were modeled to account for formic acid formation, both of them involving cyclic intermediates. According to the computed activation free energies, the three-membered intermediate seems to be more likely to occur than the four-membered one. However, reaction barriers are very high and only a very small proportion of formic acid is expected to be formed through such intermediates. In the presence of NOx, considered in this work for the first time, the main product of the tropospheric oxidation of acetylene is also expected to be glyoxal.\r\nSN  - 1432-2234\r\nUR  - https://doi.org/10.1007/s00214-008-0467-y\r\nDO  - 10.1007/s00214-008-0467-y\r\nID  - Galano2008\r\nER  -', 'C@C', 'Acetylenee.png', NULL, 'true', NULL, NULL),

It was found to be a rather poor primary antioxidant, not efficient as a peroxyl radical scavenger, albeit it may be able of scavenging other, more reactive, free radicals. On the contrary, it was found to be an excellent secondary antioxidant, through metal chelation. Anthranilic acid is proposed to be a proper OH-inactivating ligand, with ways of action that depend on the strength of the reductant. It is able of chelating Cu(II) ions and fully prevent them from reduction by not too strong reductants such as the ascorbate ion. Accordingly, it is predicted to behave as an efficient antioxidant for in vitro experiments using Cu(II)–ascorbate mixtures as oxidant. On the other hand, anthranilic acid is able of downgrading the production of OH in biological systems, where stronger reductants such as the superoxide radical anion are present, but only partially. However, under such conditions it would be efficient for deactivating this radical as it is formed through Fenton-like reactions. Accordingly, anthranilic would be an efficient protector against the OH associated oxidative stress through its secondary antioxidant activity.\nER  -', 'C1=CC=C(C(=C1)C(=O)O)N', 'anthranilic_acid.png', NULL, 'true', NULL, NULL),
